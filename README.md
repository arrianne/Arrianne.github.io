#### Still to do....

I really want to make it more accessible so will be updating alt tags in html etc.
I want to expand the homepage to include a skills section and add a bit more fun stuff in the about section.
I want to add a 'fun mode' toggle button at the top which will add more colour an pazazz to my overall site.
I want to add hover states to nav links.

My list could probably go on and on and on..
